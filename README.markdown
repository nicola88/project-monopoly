Project Monopoly
================

Introduction
------------

_Project Monopoly_ has born as a university project for a object-oriented programming course at my (actual) university (Padova, Italy); it's inspired by the well known board game Monopoly but it's more simple and implements a quite different set of rules.

In its actual implementation, the game offers exactly the features requested for the projects and few more: it's possible to play on a local PC with four players (no more, no less) according to the rules defined in the specifications document (progetto.pdf - currently available in Italian).

Development
-----------

_Project Monopoly_ has been developed with C++/Qt.
